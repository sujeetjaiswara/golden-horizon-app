# Commit

Create one or more conventional commits from the current changes.

## Steps

1. Unless `--no-verify` is passed, run pre-commit checks and stop on failure (ask whether to fix or proceed):
   - `bun run lint`
   - `bun run build`
2. Run `git status` to see staged files:
   - If files are already staged, commit ONLY those files.
   - If nothing is staged, stage all modified and new files.
3. Run `git diff --staged` to understand the changes.
4. If the diff contains multiple distinct logical changes, propose splitting into separate commits and stage/commit each group separately.
5. Write the commit message(s) per the format below.

## Commit Message Format

```
<emoji> <type>(<scope>): <description>
```

- **Scope** (optional): feature folder name, e.g. `feat(departments): ...`, `fix(leaves): ...`
- Imperative, present tense: "add feature", not "added feature"
- First line under 72 characters, no trailing period
- Exactly one emoji, prefixed, matching the type:
